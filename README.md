# OreSat C3 Software

Software for Linux version of the C3 card.

Like all OreSat software projects it is built using OLAF (OreSat Linux App
Framework), which it built ontop of [CANopen for Python]. See the
[oresat-olaf repo] for more info about OLAF.

## Quickstart

Install dependenies

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Make a virtual CAN bus

```bash
$ sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
$ sudo ip link set vcan0 up
```

Run the C3 app

```bash
$ python3 -m oresat_c3
```

Can select the CAN bus to use (`vcan0`, `can0`, etc) with the `-b BUS` arg.

Can mock hardware by using the `-m HARDWARE` flag.

- The`-m all` flag can be used to mock all hardware (CAN bus is always
required).
- The `-m rtc` flag would only mock the RTC and expect all other hardware
to exist.

See other options with `-h` flag.

A basic [Flask]-based website for development and integration can be found at
`http://localhost:8000` when the software is running.

## Project Layout

- `docs/`: Source of Read the Docs documentation.
- `oresat_c3/`: Source code.
  - `data/`: Holds the CANopen EDS and DCF files for project.
  - `drivers/`: Fully stand-alone (doesn't import anything else from project)
    Pythonic drivers used by project. All drivers can mock hardware it's for.
  - `protocols/`: Anything dealing with packing or unpacking beacon and EDL
    packets.
  - `resources/`: OLAF resources, the "glue" between protocol, drivers, and/or
    subsystems with the CANopen node.
  - `subsystems/`: Anything dealing with the subsystems of the C3 other than the
    CAN bus.
  - `templates/`: The [Flask]-based templates to add OLAF's REST API to be used
    for development and integration (not used in production).
- `tests/`: Unit tests.
