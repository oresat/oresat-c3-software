    CubeSat
        A small satellite is made up of multiples of 10cm × 10cm × 10cm cubic units.

    OreSat
        PSAS's open source CubeSat. See https://www.oresat.org/

    PSAS
        Portland State Aerospace Society. A student aerospace group at Portland State University.

    SDR
        Software-Defined Radio. Radio communications that are traditionally implemented in hardware
        are instead implemented in software.

    C3
        Command, communication, and control card. It is the flight computer for OreSat.

    CAN
        Control Area Network. A message bus for embedded systems common in the automotive industry.

    CANopen
        A communication protocol and device profile specification for a CAN bus defined by CAN in
        Automation. More info at https://can-cia.org/

    OPD
        OreSat Power Domain. Allows the C3 to turn other cards on or off.

    UniClOGS
        University Class Open Ground Station. The ground station for OreSat.
        See https://www.uniclogs.org/

    EDL
        Engineering Data Link. The main communication data link between OreSat and UniClOGS used
        for commanding OreSat and uploading/downloading files to/from OreSat.

    SatNOGS
        A open source global network of satellite ground stations. See https://satnogs.org/

    OreFlat
        FlatSat and FlatClOGS together. A full HIL satellite and ground station for integration
        and testing.

    Telecommand
        A command message sent to a satellite.

    Telemetry
        Health and status information from a satellite.

    OTA
        Over the Air. Any type of wireless transmission.

    Octet
        A unit of 8-bits. In communications, it is common to the unit octet, as the unit byte has
        historically been platform-dependent, while an octet has always been 8-bits.

    CCSDS
        Consultative Committee for Space Data System. A committee of governmental space-agencies
        to discuss and develop standards for space data and information systems.

        missions for space-to-ground or space-to-space communications links.

    CFDP
        CCSDS File Delivery Protocol. A CCSDS file transfer protocol to be used by space missions.

    XTCE
        XML Telemetric and Command Exchange. An XML-based file for defining a spacecraft's
        telemetry and telecommand data format.
